# Administrative Division Terminology for 198 geoBoundaries Countries

This comprehensive reference provides the proper English administrative division terminology for all 198 countries and territories in the geoBoundaries dataset. **ADM0** consistently represents the country/territory level, with subsequent levels (ADM1–ADM5) representing progressively smaller administrative units. The terminology reflects internationally recognized English names used by ISO 3166-2, UN OCHA, and national statistics offices—optimized for international development and research contexts.

## Key terminology patterns and notes

**ADM0 classification follows these rules:**
- **Country** = Sovereign states
- **Territory** = Dependent territories (British Overseas Territories, French overseas departments/collectivities, US territories, associated states)
- **Continent** = Antarctica (special case)

**Regional terminology patterns emerge across linguistic and colonial heritage:**

| Pattern | ADM1 | ADM2 | ADM3 | Examples |
|---------|------|------|------|----------|
| Francophone Africa | Region | Department/Circle | Arrondissement/Commune | Senegal, Mali, Benin |
| Anglophone Africa | State/Province | District/LGA | Ward | Nigeria, Kenya, Tanzania |
| Arab States | Governorate | District | - | Egypt, Jordan, Iraq, Syria |
| Former Soviet | Oblast/Region | Raion/District | - | Kazakhstan, Ukraine, Belarus |
| Latin America | Department/State | Municipality | District | Colombia, Brazil, Guatemala |
| Pacific Islands | Province/Division/State | District | Village | Fiji, PNG, Micronesia |

**Notable special cases for implementation:**

1. **United States (USA)**: ADM2 varies—**Counties** in most states, **Parishes** in Louisiana, **Boroughs/Census Areas** in Alaska, **Independent Cities** in Virginia and other states
2. **India (IND)**: geoBoundaries dataset begins at ADM1 (no ADM0 layer)
3. **Puerto Rico (PRI)**: Dataset begins at ADM2 (no ADM0-1 layers)
4. **United Kingdom (GBR)**: Administrative structure differs significantly between England, Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland
5. **China (CHN)**: ADM1 includes provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities (Beijing, Shanghai, etc.), and special administrative regions (Hong Kong, Macau)
6. **Russia (RUS)**: Federal subjects include 6 different types: republics, krais, oblasts, federal cities, autonomous oblast, and autonomous okrugs
7. **French overseas territories**: Follow French administrative structure (arrondissements, communes) but may skip intermediate levels in geoBoundaries
